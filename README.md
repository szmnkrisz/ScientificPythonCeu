# ScientificPythonCeu
Scientific Python was a course at CEU I attended in the 2018 Fall Semester.
Topics covered:
- manipulating strings, dictionaries, lambda functions, lists
- numpy, matplotlib
- pandas, seaborn
- .json files
- error handling
- graphs, network visualization

For my final project, I presented a phenomenon in sports betting, which is the fact that in the long run, betting on high probability events lead to a minimal loss (1-2%), whereas betting on unlikely events result in substantial losses of 50-60%. I analyzed 5000 football games played in the English Premier League in a 13-year span to support this statement.
